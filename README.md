# Infrastructure-as-Code
Automate cloud infra with Terraform. Define stack as code for easy versioning, maintenance &amp; reproducibility. Reliable IaC for cloud management.

Welcome to the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) repository! This project aims to automate the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using Terraform, a popular open-source IaC tool. With IaC, we can define our entire infrastructure stack as code, making it easier to version, maintain, and reproduce our infrastructure consistently and reliably.
